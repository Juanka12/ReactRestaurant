# ReactRestaurant
 
This is a web/app to test ReactJS.

In this functional project I have multiple components and pages, all of the pages are routed correctly to navigate between them.

Firstly the app has a Navbar divided in two where the bottom one sticks to the top of the page, then at the bottom there is a Footer to display information about the web, company ...

Naturally the project has some pages :

**Home** to display useful information to the user, mainly there is a carousel and two banners.

**Carta** displays all the available products in cards with a short description, the items come from a json file but can be replaced with any database.

**Offers** shows tickets for the client to select.

**About** is a short questionnaire to fill if the user has any question to ask, it shows main information about the company too.
